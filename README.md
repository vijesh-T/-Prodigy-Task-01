CAESAR CIPHER ENCRYPTION & DECRYPTIOIN


Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encryption and decryption. It operates by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. 

Here's how it works:
Encryption:-
Choose a Shift: Decide on a number (key) between 1 and 25. This key determines how many positions each letter in the plaintext will be shifted.

Shift Letters: For each letter in the plaintext:

If the letter is a lowercase or uppercase English letter (A-Z or a-z), shift it by the specified number of positions in the alphabet. Wrap around the alphabet if necessary. For example, shifting 'Z' by 1 gives 'A'. Create Cipher Text: Replace each letter in the plaintext with the shifted letter to form the ciphertext.

Decryption:-

Decryption with Caesar cipher involves reversing the encryption process:

Know the Shift:- You need to know the exact key (number of positions shifted) used for encryption.

Shift Back:- For each letter in the ciphertext:

Shift it backwards by the same number of positions used in encryption. Again, wrap around the alphabet as needed. Retrieve Plain Text: Replace each letter in the ciphertext with the decrypted letter to retrieve the original plaintext.



Conclusion:


The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program offers a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. By combining simplicity with functionality, the project serves as an effective tool for learning cryptographic principles and promoting cybersecurity awareness.
