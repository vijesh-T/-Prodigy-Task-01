CAESAR CIPHER ENCRYPTION & DECRYPTIOIN


Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encryption and decryption. It operates by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. 

Here's how it works:
Encryption:-
Choose a Shift: Decide on a number (key) between 1 and 25. This key determines how many positions each letter in the plaintext will be shifted.

Shift Letters: For each letter in the plaintext:

If the letter is a lowercase or uppercase English letter (A-Z or a-z), shift it by the specified number of positions in the alphabet. Wrap around the alphabet if necessary. For example, shifting 'Z' by 1 gives 'A'. Create Cipher Text: Replace each letter in the plaintext with the shifted letter to form the ciphertext.

Decryption:-

Decryption with Caesar cipher involves reversing the encryption process:

Know the Shift:- You need to know the exact key (number of positions shifted) used for encryption.

Shift Back:- For each letter in the ciphertext:

Shift it backwards by the same number of positions used in encryption. Again, wrap around the alphabet as needed. Retrieve Plain Text: Replace each letter in the ciphertext with the decrypted letter to retrieve the original plaintext.
